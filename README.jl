# ReviseTest.jl
This repo is to demonstrate and test Revise.jl under 2 modes, auto or manual Revise mode.  The script `run_revise_test` is given for both Windows and Linux.  To run on Windows...

```batch
run_revise_test.bat [N] [REVISE_MODE]
```

Or on Linux...

```bash
./run_revise_test.sh [N] [REVISE_MODE]
```

From my own tests, `i` rarely is able to exceed 3 on Windows or Linux.
